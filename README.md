# Hey there, I'm Kha Le 👋

Senior Frontend Developer with 9+ years building web applications that scale. I specialize in React and Vue, turning complex problems into clean, performant solutions.

## About Me

I've spent nearly a decade in frontend development, working across the full spectrum of web applications—from rapid prototypes to enterprise-scale systems serving thousands of users. My strength lies in taking challenging technical problems and breaking them down into maintainable, scalable architectures.

Whether it's optimizing bundle sizes, refactoring legacy codebases, or architecting new features from the ground up, I focus on shipping code that works reliably and performs well. I've worked extensively with both React and Vue ecosystems, which gives me flexibility in choosing the right tool for each project.
